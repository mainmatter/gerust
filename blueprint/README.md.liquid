## Project Structure

Distinct parts of the project are separated into separate crates:

```
.
├── cli    // CLI tools for e.g. running DB migrations or generating project files
├── config // Defines the `Config` struct and handles building the configuration from environment-specific TOML files and environment variables
{%- unless template_type == "minimal" %}
├── db     // Encapsulates database access, migrations, as well as entity definitions and related code (if the project uses a database)
{%- endunless %}
├── macros // Contains macros, e.g. for application tests
└── web    // The web interface as well as tests for it
```

## Commands
