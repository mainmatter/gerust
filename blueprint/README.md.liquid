# {{project-name}}

This README explains how to collaborate on this Gerust application.
{% if template_type == "full" %}
The example application implements a simple tasks management system. [Tasks](./db/src/entities/tasks.rs) are stored in PostgreSQL and can be [created, read, updated, and deleted](./web/src/controllers/tasks.rs) via the web interface. Any writing operations [require authentication via a token](./web/src/middlewares/auth.rs).

## Prerequisites

* Rust (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
{%- unless template_type == "minimal" %}
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
{%- endunless %}

## Project Structure

Distinct parts of the project are separated into separate crates:

```
.
├── cli    // CLI tools for{%- unless template_type == "minimal" -%} running DB migrations or{%- endunless %} generating project files
├── config // Defines the `Config` struct and handles building the configuration from environment-specific TOML files and environment variables
{%- unless template_type == "minimal" %}
├── db     // Encapsulates database access, migrations, as well as entity definitions and related code (if the project uses a database)
{%- endunless %}
├── macros // Contains macros for application tests
└── web    // The web interface as well as tests for it
```

### Environment

The project uses `.env` and `.env.test` files to store configuration settings for the development and test environments respectively. Those files are read automatically by the parts of the application that require configuration settings to be present.
{% unless template_type == "minimal" %}
A Docker setup with preconfigured databases for the development and test environments is created out-of-the-box with the project. Boot the containers with

```sh
docker compose up
```

The `.env` and `.env.test` contain matching configuration out-of-the-box.

cargo test
```
{% unless template_type == "minimal" %}
Running database tasks like executing migrations or seeding the database (see the [CLI create](./cli/README.md) for detailed documentation):

```sh
cargo db
```
{% endunless %}
Generating project files like entities, controllers, tests, etc. (see the [CLI create](./cli/README.md) for detailed documentation):

```sh
cargo generate
```
